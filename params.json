Windows is not supported.\r\n* Ruby 1.9.3p194 or above\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nRun rails/rake commands using rrails:\r\n\r\n    $ export RAILS_ENV=development         # optionally\r\n    $ rrails rails generate model Yakiniku # first command, slow\r\n    $ rrails rails server                  # fast\r\n    $ rrails rails console                 # fast\r\n    $ rrails rake db:migrate               # fast\r\n    $ rrails rake routes                   # fast\r\n    $ rrails -- rake -T                    # '--' is needed. Otherwise '-T' will be parsed by rrails\r\n\r\nFor more options, run:\r\n\r\n    $ rrails --help\r\n\r\n### Shell integration\r\n\r\nYou may want to add following lines to your shell rc file:\r\n\r\n    rrails-exec() {\r\n        if [ -e config/environment.rb ]; then\r\n            # this might be slow, see below\r\n            rrails -- \"$@\"\r\n        else\r\n            command \"$@\"\r\n        fi\r\n    }\r\n    alias rails='rrails-exec rails'\r\n    alias rake='rrails-exec rake'\r\n\r\nDirectly running `rrails` (even without `bundle exec`) may be slow due to levels of dummy wrappers of Bundler.\r\nYou can replace `rrails` with an absolute path `/(path_to_rrails_gem)/bin/rrails` to get rid of Bundle initializing code.\r\nThis can save about 0.9 seconds.\r\n\r\nThese lines (with correct absolute path) can be generated by `rrails shellrc`. So you can quickly update your shell rc file using:\r\n\r\n    rrails shellrc >> ~/.zshrc\r\n\r\n### Bundler\r\n\r\nrrails works with bundler. Ususally `bundle exec` (which is slow) is not needed. `gem 'rrails'` is not required in Gemfile, either.\r\n\r\nIn case you want to make sure Gemfile is in use, or rrails version is specified in Gemfile, just run this before others:\r\n\r\n    $ bundle exec rrails start\r\n\r\n### PTY mode\r\n\r\nrrails's PTY mode makes sure that interactive things (like line editing)\r\nwork correctly. Note it also redirect all STDERR to STDOUT and keys like `^C` \r\nmay not work correctly.\r\n\r\nPTY mode is enabled only for `rails console` and `rails db` by default.\r\nIf you need an interactive console for other commands, you can add `--pty` option:\r\n\r\n    $ rrails --pty rails server            # if debugger is in use\r\n\r\nNote: PTY mode does not support nested programs. For example, `pry` runs `less` \r\nas its pager. This doesn't work properly. You need disable the pager of pry:\r\n\r\n    Pry.config.pager = false\r\n\r\n### The server\r\n\r\nBy default, rrails will start a server process on demand per project per rails\\_env.\r\nThe server writes pid and socket files to `./tmp/` and remove them when exiting.\r\n\r\nYou can control the server using:\r\n\r\n    $ export RAILS_ENV=development         # optionally\r\n    $ rrails stop\r\n    $ rrails restart\r\n    $ rrails reload\r\n    $ rrails status\r\n\r\n## See Also\r\n\r\n* guard-rrails: https://github.com/walf443/guard-rrails\r\n* rails-sh: https://github.com/jugyo/rails-sh\r\n\r\n## Contributing to rrails\r\n\r\n* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.\r\n* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it.\r\n* Fork the project.\r\n* Start a feature/bugfix branch.\r\n* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.\r\n* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.\r\n* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2012 Keiji, Yoshimi. https://github.com/walf443/ <br>\r\nCopyright (c) 2012 Wu Jun. https://github.com/quark-zju\r\n\r\nSee LICENSE.txt for further details.\r\n","google":"35592837"}
